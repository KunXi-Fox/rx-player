# getAvailableAudioTracks

## Description

### Returned object

Returns the list of available audio tracks for the current content.

Each of the objects in the returned array have the following properties:

- `active` (`Boolean`): Whether the track is the one currently active or not. Only maximum
  one audio track can be active at a time.

- `id` (`string`): The id used to identify the track. Use it for setting the track via
  `setAudioTrack`.

- `language` (`string`): The language the audio track is in, as set in the
  [Manifest](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#manifest).

- `normalized` (`string`): An attempt to translate the `language` property into an ISO
  639-3 language code (for now only support translations from ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2
  language codes). If the translation attempt fails (no corresponding ISO 639-3 language
  code is found), it will equal the value of `language`

- `audioDescription` (`Boolean`): Whether the track is an audio description of what is
  happening at the screen.

- `dub` (`Boolean|undefined`): If set to `true`, this audio track is a "dub", meaning it
  was recorded in another language than the original. If set to `false`, we know that this
  audio track is in an original language. This property is `undefined` if we do not known
  whether it is in an original language.

- `label` (`string|undefined`): A human readable label that may be displayed in the user
  interface providing a choice between audio tracks.

  This information is usually set only if the current Manifest contains one.

- `representations` (`Array.<Object>`):
  [Representations](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#representation) of this audio track,
  with attributes:

  - `id` (`string`): The id used to identify this Representation.

  - `bitrate` (`Number|undefined`): The bitrate of this Representation, in bits per
    seconds.

    `undefined` if unknown.

  - `codec` (`string|undefined`): The audio codec the Representation is in, as announced
    in the corresponding Manifest.

  - `isSpatialAudio` (`Boolean|undefined`): If set to `true`, this Representation has
    spatial audio.

  - `isCodecSupported` (`Boolean|undefined`): If `true` the codec(s) of that
    Representation is supported by the current platform.

    Note that unless you set the `filterPlayableRepresentations` option to `false`, no
    Representation with a `isCodecSupported` value of `false` will be present in this
    array (they'll all be filtered out).

    `undefined` (or not set) if support of that Representation is unknown or if does not
    make sense here.

  - `decipherable` (`Boolean|undefined`): If `true` the Representation can be deciphered
    (in the eventuality it had DRM-related protection).

    Note that unless you set the `filterPlayableRepresentations` option to `false`, no
    Representation with a `isCodecSupported` value of `false` will be present in this
    array (they'll all be filtered out).

  - `contentProtections` (`Object|undefined`): Encryption information linked to this
    Representation.

    If set to an Object, the Representation is known to be encrypted. If unset or set to
    `undefined` the Representation is either unencrypted or we don't know if it is.

    When set to an object, it may contain the following properties:

    - `keyIds` (`Array.<Uint8Array>|undefined`): Known key ids linked to that
      Representation.

### Asking for a specific Period

You can also get the list of available audio tracks for a specific Period by calling
`getAvailableAudioTracks` with the corresponding Period's id in argument. Such id can be
obtained through the `getAvailablePeriods` method, the `newAvailablePeriods` event or the
`periodChange` event.

```js
// example: getting the audio track list for the first Period
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
console.log(rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks(periods[0].id);
```

### Including Representations that cannot be played

You can also ask `getAvailableAudioTracks` to include in its response `Representation`
objects which will not be played because they have their `isCodecSupported` or
`decipherable` property set to `false` (those are filtered out by default, as indicated
above).

To do this, you can provide an object to `getAvailableAudioTracks` with a
`filterPlayableRepresentations` property set to `false` like this:

```js
const audioTrack = player.getAvailableAudioTracks();
```

You may for example also want to know which Representation are not playable to provide
debug information, or to detect deterministically the capabilities of the current device.

Note that this will return the metadata of the available audio tracks only for the current
Period. To obtain metadata on all representations for available audio tracks from another
Period, you can also set a `periodId` property:

```js
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
console.log(rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks({
    periodId: periods[0].id,
    filterPlayableRepresentations: false,
});
```

<div class="warning">
In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a
href="../Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>), if there is no
supported tracks in the file or no track management API in the browser this
method will return an empty Array.
</div>

## Syntax

```js
// Get list of available audio tracks for the currently-playing Period
const audioTracks = player.getAvailableAudioTracks();

// Also include metadata on the non-playable Representations
const audioTracks = player.getAvailableAudioTracks({
  filterPlayableRepresentations: false,
});

// Get list of available audio tracks for a specific Period
const audioTracks = player.getAvailableAudioTracks(periodId);

// Get list of available audio tracks for a specific Period and also include metadata on
// the non-playable Representations
const audioTracks = player.getAvailableAudioTracks({
  periodId,
  filterPlayableRepresentations: false,
});
```

- **arguments**:

  1.  _arg_ `Object|string|undefined`: If set to a `string`, this is the `id` of the
      Period for which you want to get information about the list of available audio
      tracks.

      If not defined, the information associated to the currently-playing Period will be
      returned.

      If set to an Object, the following properties can be set (all optional):

          - `periodId` (`string|undefined`): The `id` of the wanted Period, or
            `undefined` (or not set) for the currently-playing Period

          - `filterPlayableRepresentations` (`boolean|undefined`): If set to `false`,
            Representation that are considered "non-playable" (which have an unsupported
            mime-type/codec or which are undecipherable) will be included.

- **return value** `Array.<Object>`

# RxPlayer demos

This directory hosts the code of a demo application allowing us to showcase and more
importantly test the RxPlayer.

This directory is not exposed to the outside world and as such can change as we see fit.

Note that this directory only contains the code for the demo page. Any script allowing to
serve them or push them to a server are out of its scope.

To know how to perform those actions, you can start from the topmost documentation.
